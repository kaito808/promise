// 1. Make a request to the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/) to get a fact about your favorite number. (Make sure you get back JSON by including the json query key, specific to this API. Details.
let mynum = 100;
let url = "http://numbersapi.com/";

$.getJSON(`${url}${mynum}?json`).then(data => {console.log(data);
        });
  


// 2. Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.

let mynums = [1, 100, 158];
$.getJSON(`${url}${mynums}?json`).then(data => {console.log(data);
        });



// 3. Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them all, put them on the page. Itâ€™s okay if some of the facts are repeats.

    })
  ).then(facts => {
    facts.forEach(data => $("body").append(`<p>${data.text}</p>`));
